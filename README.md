# Pose Estimation for Markerless Tracking in Keras

Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect precise part locations in images and video, so that one could determine, 
for example, where someoneâ€™s left hand is in an image. The algorithm estimates where key =joints are and can be used to extract 
human body parts for biometric analysis in sports, locate animal body parts in a non invasive way for lab research, or locate various
objects in images.
